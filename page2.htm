			  In 2017, on average a human being spent around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/" style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">135 minutes per day on social media </font></a>  on social media, scrolling through images of friends, humorous tweets/statuses, reacting to posts and being bombarded by marketing campaigns. Advertising is seen everywhere, all the time, but how has this new technology age been able to grab a consumer’s attention through the screen? With the large scale of the internet, false advertisement is becoming easier to get away with; currently 2019 only a month and half into the year <a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au" style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">Scamwatch</font></a> 
					    states that the public has lost nearly $5,000,000 in scams online already this year. Fighting a battle to not click on a holiday to New York for 20 pounds or claiming a prize for IPad after using a Facebook game can be hard; so how do we stop ourselves and what can we look out for?<br>

The easiest way of noticing a scam would be the opposite of this; not constantly active, creating a fake brand online instead of building on a real one in real life and once getting money of customers disappearing without any connection leading to them. Finding out whether a brand is real or not online can simply be down by a few minutes of research.</p>

   			  align="justify">As you can see above two images <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tescofood/" style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">@tescofood</font></a>  is a real business account, this can be known by the verification tick from Instagram. The blue verification tick means Instagram has confirmed that an account is the authentic presence of the public figure, celebrity or global brand it represents. This is an easy way to know whether businesses are real or fake; however not all real businesses have them, just larger organisations. As <a href= "http://encore.qub.ac.uk/iii/encore_qub/record/C__Rb1900598__SJeffrey%20K.Rohrs__Orightresult__U__X4?lang=eng&suite=qub"  style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">Jeffrey K.Rohrs </font></a> states in Audience: Marketing in the Age of Subscribers, fans and following; ‘Getting an audience is HARD. Sustaining an audience is Hard. It demands consistency of thought, of purpose and of action over a long period of time’. Tesco’s Instagram also has a large number of followers, showing the user that many other users have followed and trusted this account; which would reassure the user as in real life if someone else recommends a product to you, you’re more likely to buy it. Furthermore, Tesco has a large amount of feed posts (2190), this shows that they have been on Instagram for a long period of time; a fake company trying to scam you would be able to stay active for a long period of time in order to avoid being caught. 
			  
		  
 			  <p class="w3-large"
 			  align="justify"> There are many differences between the two accounts in the photos above; looking at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kuluaairways/" style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">@kululaairways</font></a> account you can clearly see that it does not have the same presence as @tescofood. Firstly, it has no blue verification tick, which means Instagram has not verified that this is a real company unlike Tesco. With only 27 followers, this also reassures this account is fake as they are offering an incredible free holiday for the first 25,000 followers; if the account was real there would be a lot more attraction. With only one post on its feed, the account is very inactive, meaning that it does not have to reply to all the scammed users wanting a free holiday. There is 0 proof anywhere of the deal being real with 0 photos of the holiday or any person you can see behind the brand. Tesco has many professional photos which shows the user what they our buying adding trust. </p>

   			  <p class="w3-large" 
			   align="justify"> It is so easy to see the difference between real Instagram accounts and fake scams; so why do some many users fall for the scam? As a <a href= "https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.queens.ezp1.qub.ac.uk/lib/qub/detail.action?docID=320235"  style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">Lindsay Camp</font></a>  states in Can I Change Your Mind?: The Craft and Art of Persuasive Writing ‘Remember that entertaining TV commercial you saw last night? That website where you booked your last holiday? Even that mailshot you received this morning and chucked straight in the bin? They all have something to teach you about how you be better’. Social Media has the added a new pressure especially to young users to be “perfect”, this has come from the excessive use of photoshopping on Instagram and the self-awareness of what user’s post. For example, Users who could be having an awful day, post a picture of them smiling to show how “amazing” their life is, in order to get more likes/followers. Photographer Rankin created a portfolio called <a href= "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/1ba5a873-efd7-477e-9ced-6e192785afb6"  style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">'Selfie Harm'</font></a> which shows a user’s original photo and follows by what they would post on Instagram after editing the photo. This is an example of how Instagrammers deal with social media pressures and the need to be ‘perfect’ to post.

			   align="justify">Whilst this is an unhealthy habit for mental health amongst young people, it is great for companies to scam you into buying their fake produce in order to have this ‘perfect’ life that is up to “Instagram standard”.  How could your life be better? A free holiday, a new wardrobe, a free IPad or a million pounds? Scamming companies would be able to offer this for you which would entice you to put in your card details just through the desperation of having a better/happier life.

			     Another way in which people get drawn into these scams on Instagram and Social Media is the actual graphic designs of the company. Entrepreneur Europe states ‘A strong brand inspires consumers who have no prior knowledge or experience with your company to believe that you deliver an amazing product or service.’ This means if a company has a good logo it almost seems it can be trusted more, for scamming companies creating a logo is a way of convincing the user that they are real. Going back to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kuluaairways/" style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">@kululaairways</font></a> on Instagram, whilst their feed is clearly a scam one thing they have been able to do is create a logo in an attempt to convince the user to trust them.

			   There are many types of scamming: attempts to gain your personal information, buying or selling, dating and romance, fake charities, investments, jobs and employment, threats and extortion, unexpected money and unexpected winnings. Whilst these scams are seen all over the internet there are certain ways you can notice scamming within Instagram especially; <a href="https://www.scam-detector.com" style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">www.scamdetector.com</font></a>  states these are: money flipping, suspicious activity  on your own account, free stuff, deleted accounts and finally scholarships on Instagram. Instagram has a report button within the app that users can use if they see weird activity within the application. There are also many online scamming help websites that have talk rooms/comments sections in which people can inform other users of fake/spam accounts. Furthermore, in order to be completely protected users can use a malware remover every so often in order to ensure their profile is secure and free of scams.

					   Having the new law of GDPR released in 2018 it allows customers/users to more be protected. GDPR means that a company cannot have your personal details without your permission. This has protected many online users against spamming, retail companies that are present on Instagram now have to start being extremely aware of this new law. When GDPR law came out Instagram stated: “Businesses who advertise with Instagram and the Facebook companies can continue to use our platforms and solutions in the same way they do today. Each company is responsible for ensuring their own compliance with the GDPR, just as they are responsible for compliance with the laws that apply to them today”. Stating that individual companies need to follow of the GDPR the rules and Instagram does not need to take responsibility may worry the user and put them more at risk.

					   <a href="https://www.timedatasecurity.com" style="color: rgb(0,255,0)"><font color="FF00CC">Time Data Security </font></a>  states it’s an improvement on cybersecurity “Organisations have been in a continuous battle for almost as long as the internet has existed. Security upgrades in networks, servers and infrastructures have been a primary source of cyber protection along with other policy and security changes until recently. The passing of GDPR has directly impacted data privacy and security standards while also indirectly encouraging organisations to develop and improve their cybersecurity measures, limiting the risks of any potential data breach.” Whilst online scamming continues, GDPR has improved data security of online users, which could further lead to safety of their information being leaked to scamming companies.

	   			   align="justify">
				   In today’s society online scamming is very present, but hopefully with new laws/inventions scamming will slowly become a thing of the past. Whilst Instagram protects its users, nothing can stop the current generation from craving the perfect life seen in fake advertisements provided by scammers. In conclusion, whilst having an Instagram profile online is a way to communicate to the world, users must be aware that not all the accounts/businesses online are official, and they should take care when seeing suspicious activity. From writing this blog I have learnt to not believe something if it too good to be true; if it is free ask yourself why?; read the terms and conditions everytime entering important details; be aware of GDPR and keep data secure and finally the "Intsagram perfect" life is not real life and if someone is trying to sell you the "instagram perfect" life then it is most likely to be a scam.
